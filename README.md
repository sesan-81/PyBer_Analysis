# PyBer_Analysis

1)	 OVERVIEW
	 
You’ve been asked by your CEO to create an overall snapshot of the ride-sharing data. In addition to your scatter and pie charts, she would like to see a summary table of key metrics of the ride-sharing data by city type, and a multiple-line graph that shows the average fare for each week by each city type.


Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project using Matplotlib is to learn how to use graph data to create charts that visualize data in a Data Series or DataFrame using Matplotlib library and use data visualization techniques to give insight into the data from a ride sharing company called PyBer.

Resources

•	Code: PyBer_Challenge_starter_code

•	Data Source: city_data.csv; ride_data.csv

•	software: Python 3.7.6; Anaconda Navigator 4.12.0; Jupyter Notebook 6.0.1


2)	 RESULTS

The table below shows the analysis summarized the data into the three city types of Urban, Suburban and Rural and created metrics to show total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver.

3)	 SUMMARY

There are significantly more rides in Urban cities than Suburban and Rural areas. The number of drivers also follows that same pattern with more drivers being in Urban cities. The average fare per ride and average fare per driver are actually more expensive in the rural areas and cheaper in the Urban cities. This tells us that as a ride shares service has more drivers available the ride expenses or fares become cheaper on average. However, it is interesting to note that a missing piece of crucial data is the length of the ride. Its possible that since rural areas might require longer rides, that the data is skewed by the duration of the ride causing an increase in fares.
